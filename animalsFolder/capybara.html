			<h1>Capybaras</h1>
			<p>
				Coming in at number two, fan favorite cabybara is a very soild choice.
				This member of the genus Hydrochoerus is the largest surviving rodent.
				Subsiting on a diet of grass, seaweed, clams, mussels, and other small
				plants, the capybara is very well suited for its South American home.
				The capybara can be kept as a pet without a licence.
