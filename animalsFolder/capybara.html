				Coming in at number two, fan-favorite capybara is a very solid choice.
                This member of the genus Hydrochoerus is the largest surviving rodent.
                Subsisting on a diet of grass, seaweed, clams, mussels, and other small
                plants, the capybara is very well suited for its South American home.
                The capybara can be kept as a pet without a license.
