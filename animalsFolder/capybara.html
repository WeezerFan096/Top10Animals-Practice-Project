    <h1>Capybara</h1>
    <p1>
        Coming in at number two, fan favorite cabybara is a very soild choice. This member of the genus Hydrochoerus 
        is the largest surviving rodent. Subsiting on a diet of grass, seaweed, clams, mussels, and other small plants,
        the capybara is very well suited for its South American home. The capybara can be kept as a pet without a 
        licence.
