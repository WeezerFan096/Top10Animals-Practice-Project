		<p>
			Dogs (Canis familiaris) are the domesticated descendants of the wolf. The dogs were the first species to be
             domesticated by humans, making them mankind's oldest and best friend. Dogs are largely carnivores, but 
             will also eat plant-based foods. Dogs are very social animals with the ability to provide cuddles and 
             emotional support.
