                Hedgehogs (genus Erinaceidae) are spiny mammals which are primarily active
                during the day. They feed on insects, berries, melons, eggs, frogs, toads,
                and mushrooms. Hedgehogs are also domesticated, making for a fun and
                low-maintenance pet. Although their spines aren't cuddly, hedgehogs make
                friendly and playful pets.
