		<h1>The Coatimundi</h1>
		<p>
			The Coatimundi (genus Nasua) is a part of the raccoon family found in Arizona and South America. They hang
			out in the trees of the mountains. These social animals live in large groups and even babysit each other's 
			offspring. Through chirping, they communicate with their offspring and alert each other to danger. They are
			 very vital in their ecosystems as they control insect populations, disperse seeds, and aerate the soil.
